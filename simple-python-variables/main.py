### VARIABLES
# variables are containers for storing values
# instead of repeating a single string we can use variable
# like this ...

name = "Alireza Ghahremani Masoom Abad"
# name is VAR and i assign my name to it
print(f"My name is {name}")
print(f"Is my name ({name}) too short ?? :)")

# we can seprate words in single VARname with __ like m_yme
# NOTE : there some keywords that they called reserved keywords
# Gooooooogle it :-()


# we can just change the variables value insted of change whole code
